## Description

ols1clk is a one-click installation script for OpenLiteSpeed. Using this script, you can quickly and easily install OpenLiteSpeed with it’s default settings. We also provide a **-W** parameter that will install WordPress at the same time but it must still be configured through the wp-config.php page. A MariaDB database can also be set up using this script if needed. If you already have a WordPress installation running on another server, it can be imported into OpenLiteSpeed with no hassle using the **--wordpresspath** parameter. To completely install WordPress with your OpenLiteSpeed installation, skipping the need for the wp-config.php page, use the **--wordpressplus** flag. This can be used with **--wpuser**, **--wppassword**, **--wplang**, and **--sitetitle** to configure each of the settings normally set by wp-config.php.

## Running ols1clk

ols1clk can be run in the following way:
```
./ols1clk.sh [options] [options] …

## FAQ
### How do I create additional Virtual Hosts from console?
Run the following command to create an additional virtual host in a few seconds. The example document root will be **/var/www/www.example.com**. Be sure to substitute your own domain. 
```
/bin/bash <( curl -sk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litespeedtech/ls-cloud-image/master/Setup/vhsetup.sh ) -d www.example.com
```

### How do I create additional Virtual Hosts with WordPress from console?
The first time you create an additional Virtual Host, you will need to get your database root password from **/usr/local/lsws/password**, then echo the password to the specified location. Be sure to substitute your own password for `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD`. 
```
echo 'root_mysql_pass="DB_ROOT_PASSWORD"' > /root/.db_password
```
If your system has no `unzip` package preinstalled, then install it. `apt-get install unzip -y` for Debian, and `yum -y install unzip` for CentOS system. 

Then run the following command to create an additional virtual host with Wordpress.
```
/bin/bash <( curl -sk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litespeedtech/ls-cloud-image/master/Setup/vhsetup.sh ) -d www.example.com -w
```

### How to I create additional Virtual Hosts and LE certificate from console?
The first time you do this, you will need to install [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) on your system. Use `apt-get -y install certbot` for Ubuntu 20.04. 

Please be sure that your domain is already pointing to the server.

Then run the following command to create an additional virtual host with a Let's Encrypt certificate applied. Be sure to substitute your own domain and your email address. 
```
/bin/bash <( curl -sk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litespeedtech/ls-cloud-image/master/Setup/vhsetup.sh ) -d www.example.com -le admin@example.com -f
```
Note: The `-f` option is to force https redirection
